# ONLINE-GROCERY-RECOMMENDATION
Online grocery products recommendation systemsGrocery Recommendation System
Project Overview
The Grocery Recommendation System is an innovative solution designed to enhance shopping experiences by providing personalized grocery suggestions. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, this system analyzes user purchase history and preferences to recommend products that shoppers are likely to purchase. This project aims to streamline grocery shopping, reduce decision fatigue, and increase customer satisfaction.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: Tailor suggestions based on individual user purchase histories.

Seasonal Suggestions: Recommends products that are in season, ensuring freshness and relevance.

Real-Time Inventory Integration: Connects with grocery inventory systems to suggest only available items.

Technologies Used
Python: For scripting and model development.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Flask: To create a web application interface for the recommendation system.
Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

git clone https://github.com/godwino/ONLINE-GROCERY-RECOMMENDATION.git
cd ONLINE-GROCERY-RECOMMENDATION
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the recommendation system:
python app.py

Navigate to localhost:8888 in your web browser to interact with the system.

Data
The system uses a dataset comprising user purchase history, product details, and user feedback. This data is sourced from [Data Source Name], and it can be obtained as follows:

Models and Algorithms
We use collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide recommendations. These methods were chosen for their effectiveness in understanding user preferences and suggesting relevant items.

Evaluation
The system's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Initial tests have shown a 20% increase in user engagement and satisfaction compared to traditional recommendation methods.
